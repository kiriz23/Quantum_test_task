# Task 1 Natural language processing
This project performs named entity recognition(NER) for labeling mountains in text using fine-tuned BERT model.

## Project structure
The solution of given task was done in Jupyter notebooks and consists of two files:
* [DatasetCreation](https://github.com/kiriz23/Quantum_test_task/blob/main/Task1/notebooks/DatasetCreation.ipynb)
* [Demo](https://github.com/kiriz23/Quantum_test_task/blob/main/Task1/notebooks/Demo.ipynb)

DataCreation file explains the process of creating the dataset, and Demo file presents the solution - that is, trainig the BERT model and performing inference for some text.
There is also a .py scripts in [python_scripts](https://github.com/kiriz23/Quantum_test_task/tree/main/Task1/python_scripts) folder, they are basically splitted parts of Demo.ipynb notebook.


In [dataset](https://github.com/kiriz23/Quantum_test_task/tree/main/Task1/dataset) folder there are two versions of dataset - one is dataset_bio(this dataset was generated by ChatGPT and labeled by code), and the other is improved_data(this file was created and labeled by ChatGPT). I recommend using improved_data because that dataset is bigger **BUT** it also has some problems - for example, not all words are labeled correctly. I would love to fix this, but I also want to solve the second task before this.

## How to use 
Download one of two datasets(again, I would recommend improved_data), install all requirements, then run the code either in .ipynb or .py files
